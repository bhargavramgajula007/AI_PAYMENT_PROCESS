AI-Powered Payments Approval & Fraud 
Intelligence 
The Challenge 
How might we build an AI system that automates payment approvals and detects 
transaction fraud in real-time - turning a manual bottleneck into instant, intelligent 
decisions? 
The Problem 
Payments teams review hundreds of payout requests daily, checking multiple systems for each 
one. Meanwhile, fraud hides in plain sight because manual reviews can't keep pace with 
sophisticated patterns. 
"I approve payouts all day. Each one requires checking multiple systems for red flags. 
Most could be instant, but the system can't decide - so I click through the same checks 
over and over." 
"Client uses a restricted card. I see the error a day later, manually review the account, 
then lock it. By then, they've made more transactions." 
"Fraudster deposits, makes one tiny trade, withdraws immediately. I know the pattern, 
but I'm reviewing these cases one by one after they've already happened." 
"When a fraud incident hits - stolen cards, coordinated abuse - I prepare files to lock 
accounts, recover funds, notify clients. Takes hours. High error risk." 
The core issue: manual approval doesn't scale, and reactive fraud detection is always too late. 
AI can approve the legitimate and flag the suspicious - instantly. 
Why This Matters Now 
Trading platforms process thousands of daily payments across dozens of payment methods. 
The industry faces common challenges: 
● Low auto-approval rates - payments officers spending hours on routine decisions that 
could be automated 
● Fraud detected too late - card errors, suspicious patterns found after losses occur 
● No real-time risk scoring - decisions based on incomplete information 
● Slow incident response - bulk actions require manual preparation 
● Alert fatigue - teams buried in false positives while real fraud slips through 
The result: legitimate customers wait unnecessarily, fraudsters exploit detection gaps, and 
teams drown in reactive work. 
The Opportunity 
Build an AI-powered payments intelligence system that makes two critical decisions faster and 
better than humans: 
1. Intelligent Payout Approval: 
● Instant risk assessment: Evaluate every payout request against multiple fraud signals in 
seconds 
● Multi-signal decisioning: Payment method status, transaction velocity, geographic 
consistency, trading behaviour, historical patterns 
● Smart auto-approval: Process the vast majority of clean payouts instantly with clear 
reasoning 
● Intelligent escalation: Flag suspicious cases with evidence for human review 
● Continuous learning: Improve accuracy based on officer feedback 
2. Real-Time Fraud Detection & Response: 
● Behavioural pattern detection: "No trade" fraud (deposit → minimal trading → immediate 
withdrawal), "short trade" abuse, card testing, velocity abuse 
● Technical fraud signals: Card errors, failed login attempts, geographic impossibilities, 
device fingerprint anomalies 
● Automated response: High risk → auto-lock + notify; Medium risk → flag + monitor; Low 
risk → approve + log 
● Bulk incident handling: One-click bulk locks, automated fund recovery, auto-generated 
client communications 
● Real-time exposure calculation: Instant quantification of fraud ring impact 
Example - Auto-Approved Payout: 
Withdrawal request → AUTO-APPROVED (High Confidence) 
● Payment method verified (used multiple times, no issues) 
● Amount within normal range for this customer 
● Geographic match (consistent with recent logins) 
● Active trading history 
● Processing time: seconds 
Example - Escalated for Review: 
Withdrawal request → ESCALATED (Elevated Risk Score) 
● New payment method (first-time use) 
● Unusual amount (significantly higher than previous withdrawals) 
● Geographic anomaly (VPN detected) 
● Minimal trading activity 
● Pattern match: Similar to confirmed fraud cases 
Example - Fraud Detection: 
FRAUD ALERT: "No Trade" Fraud Pattern Detected (High Confidence) 
● Recent deposit via card 
● Minimal trading activity (single small trade, closed immediately) 
● Withdrawal request for nearly the full deposit amount 
● Automated actions: Withdrawal blocked, account flagged, fraud team notified, related 
accounts identified 
The system should turn manual approval bottlenecks into instant, intelligent decisions while 
catching fraud in real-time. 
Constraints

AI must add value 
Explainable decisions 
Real-time performance 
Human oversight 
Show real automation with sample transactions. 
This is an AI hackathon. GenAI must be core to your solution. 
Every approval/block must have clear reasoning. 
Decisions in seconds, not minutes or hours. 
AI decides routine cases; humans handle edge cases. 
Questions Worth Considering 
● What signals are most predictive of fraud vs. false alarms? 
● How do you handle brand-new customers with no behavioural history? 
● When should AI be conservative (block) vs. aggressive (approve)? 
● Can you detect fraud patterns that don't match any known typology? 
● How do you balance speed (instant approval) with accuracy (catch fraud)? 
● What's the right interface for fraud investigators reviewing alerts? 
● Can the system explain why one withdrawal is approved and another flagged? 

What Would Blow Our Minds 
● Dramatic auto-approval increase: Safely processing the vast majority of payouts instantly 
while maintaining accuracy 
● Predictive fraud flagging: Identifying accounts showing pre-fraud signatures before they 
attempt withdrawal 
● Real-time pattern discovery: Detecting new fraud patterns and proactively flagging 
similar accounts 
● Incident response in seconds: Detecting fraud rings and executing bulk containment 
actions instantly 
● Learning from outcomes: Measurable improvement in approval confidence based on 
validated decisions 
● Natural language fraud queries: "Show me accounts that deposited but traded minimally"
